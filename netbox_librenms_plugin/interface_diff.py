"""
One definition of how a LibreNMS port row differs from the NetBox interface it syncs onto.

The interface table paints its columns from this, and the per-row sync button is shown from it,
so "out of sync" is decided in a single place. Every comparison asks the same question the sync
writer answers: would ``update_interface_from_port`` (plus the VLAN assignment that follows it)
change NetBox? The rule set is therefore built from the same field schema the writer uses, and
reuses the writer's own normalisers, so a row cannot be painted green against a sync that would
still write, or amber against one that would not.
