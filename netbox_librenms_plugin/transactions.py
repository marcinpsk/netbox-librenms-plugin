"""
Run a unit of work as one outermost transaction, and run it once more after a lock conflict.

PostgreSQL aborts a transaction with SQLSTATE ``40P01`` (deadlock detected), ``55P03`` (lock not
available) or ``40001`` (serialization failure). The plugin cannot prevent these: NetBox takes its
own locks in orders the plugin does not control, and PostgreSQL tells the client to retry a
``40001``. ``run_transaction`` rolls the whole attempt back and runs it once more. A second
conflict raises ``TransactionConflict``, which the HTTP adapter (``middleware.py``) shows as a
"try again" answer. The runner needs no request, so a background job can use it too.

A write of a row that another operation changed after the read is a conflict of the same kind.
``save_at_version`` saves a row only when its PostgreSQL row version (``xmin``) is still the one
that the read returned. It locks the row in ``pre_save``, at the point and in the mode of the
``UPDATE`` that follows, so the check adds no lock wait that the ``UPDATE`` does not have.

``update_existing_row`` writes one existing row under its row lock, and records the row's state
before the write, so NetBox's change log has the before-state of the row. A mapping change that
the row's ``apply`` returns is saved in the same save.

       rolls back and the next attempt starts.
    4. ``work`` returned with no conflict: the attempt commits, and its return value is returned.

    ``work`` must build its own state on each call and must not publish anything (messages,
